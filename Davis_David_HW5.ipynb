    "In this example, ﻿Z﻿ = the likelihood of a biking accident, ﻿Y﻿ = speed, and ﻿X﻿ = trail difficulty. We assume that ﻿X﻿ decreases ﻿Y﻿ causally because people decrease their speed on difficult trails. In addition, ﻿Y﻿ and ﻿X﻿ both increase ﻿Z﻿ causally because fast biking on difficult trails leads to accidents. Difficulty will be on a scale from 0 to 1, speed in miles per hour, and likelihood of an accident also on a scale from 0 to 1. (Based on the numbers, I'd say these trails are quite challenging!) \n",
